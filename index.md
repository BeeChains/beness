[327.fourth sentence; But the will is of value only when it is strictly in harmony with the laws of life. Most people do not understand this, for to them the will is equivalent to wilfulness, but a wise man knows that will and freedom are united in the Law of Be-ness.](http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Supermundane.php)
