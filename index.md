[327.fourth sentence; But the will is of value only when it is strictly in harmony with the laws of life. Most people do not understand this, for to them the will is equivalent to wilfulness, but a wise man knows that will and freedom are united in the Law of Be-ness.](http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Supermundane.php)

This flip-flop, this change from one face to the other, is a clear indication of this basic duality.
The human processes of perceiving are such that you cannot see both the faces at the same time."
